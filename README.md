# Surface Reconstruction

This project implements a surface reconstruction algorithm based on differentiable rendering. It is written in Python and leverages TensorFlow for efficient computations. The algorithm uses the Phong reflectance model for realistic surface reconstruction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/surface-reconstruction.git
    \`\`\`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd surface-reconstruction
    \`\`\`
3. Install TensorFlow:
    \`\`\`bash
    pip install tensorflow
    \`\`\`

That's it! You're now ready to run the `demo.py` file.

## Usage

To run the surface reconstruction algorithm, simply execute the `demo.py` script:

\`\`\`bash
python demo.py
\`\`\`

This will perform the reconstruction and output the result to a specified location.

After editing the configuration, re-run `demo.py` to see the effects of your changes.
